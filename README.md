# Scene3DPro (HACS)

- Sidebar entry: **3D**
- Panel title: **3D Scene Pro**
- Single scene: Floor3DPro (base) + OverlayPro (top)

## Install (Test)
1. Add this GitHub repo to HACS as a **custom repository** (Category: Integration)
2. Install **Scene3DPro**
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Integrations → Add integration → Scene3DPro**
   - This one-time step is required so Home Assistant creates a config entry (then the sidebar panel appears).
5. After adding, a **3D** item appears in the sidebar.

## Notes
- `floor3dpro-card.js` here is a placeholder; replace it with your real build output.
